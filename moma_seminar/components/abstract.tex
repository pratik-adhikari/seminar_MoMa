\begin{abstract}
The abstract should clearly state that this report is a critical analysis of your paper and in addition contain a very brief introduction to your chosen paper. This includes a short account on the general scenario and the problem that the authors address, their reasons why it is a relevant contribution, and what methods are used in order to solve it. This does \textbf{not} include an assessment on the used methods or any detailed description thereof.

The abstract should not be longer than a \textbf{third of a page}.
