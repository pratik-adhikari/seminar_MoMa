\subsection{Problem Statement}
The authors address the challenge of embodied reasoning where a robotic agent must locate specific objects within large, unexplored environments.

\textbf{POMDP formulation}
The problem is formalized as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) tuple $\mathcal{M} = (S, A, O, T, P, r)$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{S (States):} The complete state of the world, including robot pose, map, and object states (e.g., drawer open/closed) \cite{ref3}.
    \item \textbf{A (Actions):} Hybrid action space with high-level primitives (navigate, open) and low-level controllers \cite{ref5}.
    \item \textbf{O (Observations):} RGB-D images, robot pose, and semantic segmentations received by the agent \cite{ref6}.
    \item \textbf{T (Transition):} $T(s'|s, a)$ representing the probability of the state evolving from $s$ to $s'$ given action $a$ \cite{ref7}.
    \item \textbf{P (Observation model):} $P(o|s)$ representing the likelihood of receiving observation $o$ in state $s$ \cite{ref8}.
    \item \textbf{r (Reward):} Optimizing for efficient search (finding the object with minimal cost) \cite{ref9}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approach: MoMa-LLM}
MoMa-LLM grounds Large Language Models (LLMs) in dynamically built scene graphs to enable zero-shot object search.

\subsubsection{Hierarchical 3D Scene Graph}
The system builds a layered representation of the environment.

\textbf{Voronoi Graph Construction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Construction:} Created from the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD) of the inflated occupancy map, representing points equidistant to obstacles \cite{ref7}.
    \item \textbf{Utility:} Provides a safe navigational backbone that maximizes clearance from obstacles, critical for mobile manipulators \cite{ref10}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Room Classification}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prompting:} The LLM is provided with a list of object categories detected within a room cluster (e.g., "bed, lamp") \cite{ref19}.
    \item \textbf{Output:} The LLM infers the semantic room label (e.g., "Bedroom"), allowing for open-vocabulary classification \cite{ref20}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{High-Level Action Space}
The agent operates using the following discrete high-level actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Maps(room, object)}: Navigate to a specific object or location.
    \item \texttt{go\_to\_and\_open(room, object)}: Navigate to and interact with a container (e.g., fridge).
    \item \texttt{close(room, object)}: Close an opened container.
    \item \texttt{explore(room)}: Visit unexplored frontiers associated with a specific room.
    \item \texttt{done()}: Declare the task explicitly successful.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Grounded High-Level Planning}
The system converts the dynamic graph into a structured text prompt for the LLM.

\textbf{Scene Structure Encoding}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Serialization:} The graph is serialized into a hierarchical list (Room -> Objects).
    \item \textbf{Abstraction:} Distances are binned into natural language adjectives ("near", "far") and object states are explicit ("closed fridge") to facilitate reasoning \cite{ref1}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Partial Observability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontiers:} Unknown space is explicitly represented as "Unexplored Area" (local) or "Leading Out" (global) nodes, allowing the LLM to reason about exploration \cite{ref6}.
    \item \textbf{Replanning:} The prompt includes an "Analysis" and "Reasoning" step (Chain-of-Thought) before generating the next action command, with history dynamically realigned to the current map \cite{ref14}.
\end{itemize}
