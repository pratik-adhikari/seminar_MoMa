\subsection{3D Scene Graphs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hydra:} Represents the state-of-the-art in real-time 3D Scene Graph construction, abstracting geometry into topology \cite{ref1}.
    \item \textbf{Other:} Approaches like ConceptGraphs and VoroNav investigate zero-shot perception inputs for task planning \cite{ref2}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLMs for Planning}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SayPlan:} Focuses on identifying subgraphs within large, known scene graphs for planning \cite{ref5}.
    \item \textbf{Other:} LLM-Planner and other methods often restrict tasks to fully observed environments or single rooms \cite{ref6}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Object Search}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ESC:} A baseline for exploration with soft commonsense constraints, scoring frontiers based on object co-occurrences \cite{ref9}.
    \item \textbf{Other:} Classical frontier exploration and reinforcement learning methods like HIMOS (which uses hierarchical RL) \cite{ref10}.
\end{itemize}
