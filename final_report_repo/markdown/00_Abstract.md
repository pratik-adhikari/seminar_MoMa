To fully leverage mobile manipulation robots, agents must autonomously execute long-horizon tasks in large, unexplored environments [moma_llm]. This paper addresses the challenge of interactive object search, where robots must navigate, explore, and manipulate objects (e.g., opening doors and drawers) to find targets in partially observable settings [moma_llm]. We propose MoMa-LLM, a novel approach that grounds Large Language Models (LLMs) within structured representations derived from open-vocabulary scene graphs, which are dynamically updated during exploration [moma_llm]. By tightly interleaving these representations with an object-centric action space, the system achieves zero-shot, open-vocabulary reasoning [moma_llm]. To rigorously benchmark performance, we introduce a novel evaluation paradigm utilizing full efficiency curves and the Area Under the Curve for Efficiency (AUC-E) metric [moma_llm]. Extensive experiments in simulation and the real world demonstrate that MoMa-LLM substantially improves search efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines like HIMOS and ESC-Interactive [moma_llm].
